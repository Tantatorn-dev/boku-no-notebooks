#Problem
Example 7.14 Assume that in a digital communication channel, the number of bits received in error can be modeled
by a binomial random variable, and assume that the probability that a bit is received in error is
1 × 10 − 5 . If 16 million bits are transmitted, what is the probability that 150 or fewer errors occur?
Let the random variable X denote the number of errors. Then X is a binomial random variable and
$$
\begin{equation*}
P(X\leq150)   = \sum_{x=0}^{150}{16000000 \choose x} (10^{-5})^x (1-10^{-5})^{ 16000000-x}
\end{equation*}
$$
Practical Interpretation: Clearly, this probability is difficult to compute. Fortunately, the normal distribution can be
used to provide an excellent approximation in this example.
#Solution
Calculate the probability by using loop
dbinom is R builtin function for compute binomial distribution
```{r}
sum <- 0
p <- 0.00001

for (i in 0:150){
   sum <- sum + dbinom(i,size = 16000000,p)
}
print(sum)
```
